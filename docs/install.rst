Installation
============

You need Python 3.4 or higher.

After that, simply type::

   pip install tomcatmanager

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Now what?

You can use tomcatmanager :doc:`interactively from the command line or shell
<interactive>`, or you can :doc:`write your own python code which imports the
package <package>`.
